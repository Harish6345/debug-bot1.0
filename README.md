# Debug Chat Bot

Debug Chat Bot is a Python-based tool designed to help developers debug their code by automatically identifying and suggesting fixes for common errors.

## Features

- **Error Identification:** Utilizes a sandbox environment to execute code and identify errors.
- **Auto Correction:** Automatically suggests fixes for identified errors using an AI-powered code correction API.
- **Secure Execution:** Provides a secure environment for executing code snippets.
- **Open Source:** Available under an open-source license, allowing developers to contribute and customize the tool.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- An API key for accessing the AutoCodeCorrection API. You can obtain a key by signing up on [DeepAI](https://deepai.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/debug-chat-bot.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd debug-chat-bot
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your API key:

   Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in the code with your actual DeepAI API key.

### Usage

To debug code using the chat bot, you can call the `debug_code()` function and pass the code snippet as a parameter. Here's an example:

```python
from debug_bot import debug_code

code = """
# Your code snippet goes here
"""


result = debug_code(code)
print(result)
```
